You should also have `git` installed to to commit your code and submit your homework.

## Part I - Creating and building your workspace

*Catkin* is the build system for ROS. To understand what it is for and why it exists, 
read sections 1, 2 and 4 of Catkin's conceptual overview document: 
[http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview).

Set up your Catkin workspace to work with the Shutter robot:

1. Create a [workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces) called *catkin_ws* 
in your home directory. Follow the steps in this tutorial: 
[http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)

> The [tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)
page has tabs for switching between ROS versions. Follow the tutorial for the version of
ROS that you have installed in your system, e.g., Kinetic.
